# About
I'm an ML Engineer that's interested in end-to-end Machine Learning systems, MLOps and Backend Development in general.
Currently, I work as a Lead ML Engineer at [Vestas](https://www.vestas.com/).

At the moment this is a pretty boring site 🤷‍♂️, but at some point I hope to write a couple of posts on topics that I find interesting or stuff that I am learning.
