# About

{{< figure src="../images/me.jpg" width="300px" >}}

I'm a Lead ML Engineer at Vestas, where as the tech lead of the AI Center of Excellence 
I've helped scale the team from 1 to 12 people, built the internal ML/AI platform,
and delivered high-value production systems.

I've spent the last decade building machine learning systems that actually make it to production — pricing engines, fraud detection, demand forecasting, 
LLM-based extraction, and more. 
I care about business impact over exotic methods, and I believe strong software engineering is what separates ML projects that ship from those that don't.
My work spans:

- **ML/AI platforms** — infrastructure, tooling, and patterns that scale best practices across teams
- **Production ML systems** — end-to-end delivery from problem framing to deployment
- **LLM & agentic systems** — RAG, evals, structured extraction, autonomous workflows
- **Team building** — hiring, mentoring, and helping ML teams level up their engineering practices

Before Vestas, I worked as a consultant at Kapacity (now Twoday), built ML products at DFDS, and did fraud detection at ATP.

I'm based in Copenhagen, and outside of work, you might find me trying to keep up with younger basketball players on the court or hanging out with my wife and two sons.

# Get in touch
I'm always happy to chat about ML, AI, or interesting problems.
